            "The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and
            Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has
            produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts,
            your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule breaking
            will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the
            most points is awarded the House Cup, a great honour. I hope each of
            you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours." â€” Minerva
            McGonagall to first-year students on 1 September 1991, shortly
            before the Sorting Ceremony.

            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was divided into four
            Houses: Gryffindor, founded by Godric Gryffindor; Hufflepuff,
            founded by Helga Hufflepuff; Ravenclaw, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw;
            and Slytherin, founded by Salazar Slytherin.

            Houses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for
            its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shared
            the same dormitory and many classes. The houses competed throughout
            the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The
            House with the most points won the House Cup.

            In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students
            for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be
            selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and
            each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose
            future students for each House. At the beginning of each school
            year, the magical Sorting Hat was placed on each new student's head
            during the Sorting Ceremony. The Sorting Hat announced the House the
            student was to join.
